      Computer science is the study of computers and computing as well as their theoretical and practical applications. 
Computer science applies the principles of mathematics, engineering, and logic to a plethora of functions, including algorithm formulation, 
software and hardware development, and artificial intelligence.

  Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of computer science and engineering.[1] Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of robots. 
The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans. Robotics integrates fields of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering,
information engineering, mechatronics, electronics, bioengineering, computer engineering, control engineering, software engineering, mathematics, etc.
Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations for many purposes,but
today many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection of radioactive materials, bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, 
or where humans cannot survive (e.g. in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation). 
Robots can take any form, but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is claimed to help in the acceptance of robots in certain
replicative behaviors which are usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other human activity.
Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.

  India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[26] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous 
country, and the most populous democracy in the world. India is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal
 on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. It is in the vicinity
