            <ul type = "square">
                <li> In a spice-grinder, mixer-grinder or mortar-pestle, take 1.5 tablespoons coriander seeds and 5 to 6 Kashmiri red chilies. </li>
                <li> Grind to a semi fine powder or a fine powder if you prefer. Set aside. </li>
                <li> In a kadai, heat 3 tablespoons oil. Add ⅓ to ½ cup finely chopped onions. </li>
                <li> Sauté onions on medium-low to medium heat until they soften and turn translucent. </li>
                <li> Then add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste. </li>
                <li> Sauté for a few seconds till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away. </li>
                <li> Now add 2.5 to 3 cups finely chopped tomatoes. The tomatoes have to be ripe, red and sweet. If tomatoes are not in season, I recommend using canned tomatoes that you pulse in a food processor or finely chopped cherry tomatoes. </li>
                <li> Mix well and sauté tomatoes for 3 to 4 minutes on a medium-low to medium heat. </li>
                <li> Then add the ground kadai masala to the tomatoes. </li>
                <li> Mix well. Sauté the tomatoes till the whole mixture turns into a paste and starts separating from the oil. (This method is called ‘bhunao’ in Hindi.) This tomato kadai masala paste will also begin to thicken and become glossy. </li>
                <li> Now add ¾ to 1 cup capsicum julienne (thin slices). </li>
                <li> Sauté the capsicum for 3 to 4 minutes on medium-low to medium heat. </li>
                <li> Add 1 to 2 green chilies or 1 small serrano pepper (slit) and about ½ cup water. Add less or more water as required. </li>
                <li> Mix very well and sauté until the capsicum is al dente. If you prefer, you can cook the capsicum completely, but I prefer a bit of crunch to the dish. </li>
                <li> Once the capsicum is cooked to your liking, add garam masala powder and salt as required. Mix these with the rest of the masala. </li>
                <li> Now add the paneer cubes (250 grams). </li>
                <li> Again, mix very well. </li>
                <li> Lastly add 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), ginger julienne (from 1 inch ginger) and 2 tablespoons coriander leaves. Mix again and turn off the heat. </li>
                <li> Now our Kadai Paneer is ready to serve. </li>
                <li> Serve Kadai Paneer hot from the pan with roti, naan, Paratha or pudina paratha. </li>
