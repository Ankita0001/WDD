                India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage. 
                It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since its Independence. India has become self-sufficient in 
                agricultural production and is now one of the top industrialised countries in the world and one of the few 
                nations to have gone into outer space to conquer nature for the benefit of the people. It covers an area of 
                32,87,263 sq. km (1,269,346 sq mi), extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain 
                forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked 
                off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the 
                Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian 
                Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.
