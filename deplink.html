                        Established in 1972, the Department began its Honours course in 1990. The Department of Psychology at Mata Sundri College endeavours to provide 
                        a conducive environment that strives towards the professional excellence and personal development of the students. The Department emphasizes on 
                        developing the skills and attitudes that foster professional growth as well as shape students into socially responsible and sensitive citizens and 
                        able psychologists.Our focus is on equipping students to build a sound theoretical knowledge base with applied psychological skills. Backed by a 
                        diversity of pedagogical tools to enrich the learning environment, we promote critical thinking by facilitating a climate of debate and discussion 
                        to appreciate a diversity of perspectives.An active and vibrant Psychology Association, provides an opportunity for students and teachers to explore 
                        the various facets of the discipline. Organization of talks, seminars, workshops and field trips are a regular feature. The students are also guided 
                        to take up internships for the practical experience in hospitals, NGO’s and other subject related organizations. Experts from various fields engage 
                        with students and teachers to widen their horizons.The Department has a well-stocked laboratory with the latest equipment and psychological tests. 
                        The department also has three air-conditioned Laboratories equipped with Wi-Fi facilities and LCD projectors. Three laboratory Assistants are 
                        available for help.

                        Exposure to Mathematics equips students with emerging requirements for today's world including learning essential computer skills besides developing 
                        an analytic approach to real world problems. A student of honours course in mathematics is gradually trained in such logical and mathematical techniques 
                        that they have access to rewarding career opportunities in numerous sectors. With this very aim, the semester based syllabi of B. Sc. (Honours) 
                        Mathematics gain the necessary insight in diverse mathematical disciplines like algebra, analysis, mathematical modelling using differential equations, 
                        mathematical programming and statistics. A lot of emphasis is given to 'hands-on' exposure to modern software such as Mathematica, R, LaTeX and HTML 
                        through practicals.The Department of Mathematics of Mata Sundri College was established in 1978. It comprises of highly qualified and dedicated faculty 
                        members specialized in diverse areas such as Operational research, algebraic coding theory, algebra, analysis, mechanics etc.The Department also has an 
                        annual e-magazine. Each issue of our E-Magazine- ‘Anantya: Beyond Infinity’ is a milestone that marks our growth, unfolds our imaginations and gives life 
                        to our thoughts and aspirations. So far, the department has come out with 2 issues of this e-magazine. It is a combined effort of our Department Societ 
                        Asymptote’, dedicated teachers and hardworking students. It unleashes a wide spectrum of creative skills and deep knowledge of subject and aims at 
                        participation of students ranging from writing to editing and even in designing the magazine.

                        The Department of Political Science is one of the most sought-after Departments of the College which strives to provide an ambience for quality 
                        teaching and learning. Since its inception in 1969, the Department has traversed a long and eventful journey and currently carries out teaching 
                        activities with 16 academically proficient faculty members from various spheres of specialization in Political Science.The Department of Political 
                        Science strives to combine teaching, and research to educate students to Think critically and systematically about government and politics across 
                        local, national, and global settings, with regular internal assessments via class tests, tutorials, group discussions, research projects, PPTs, 
                        and assignments. To provide our students with academic exposure, the department has established many sub-societies like Knowledge club, Sambal, 
                        Cinemates along with Peer mentoring and Research programmes. These societies help our students to explore current socio-political issues and encourage                                 interaction among students and faculty. We also believe in nurturing our students to do something for the society. We have an Outreach Programme to 
                        connect our students with the society and giving back to the society. The Department also tries to equip the students with the practical ability to 
                        utilize the theoretical knowledge to understand the functioning of political institutions and political happenings around them.The department also 
                        organizes career counseling workshops at regular intervals to prepare the students for further studies and successful careers in education, law, 
                        research, public service, politics, journalism, international affairs, and numerous other fields. The Department frequently offers lectures, webinars, 
                        workshops and short-term courses exploring contemporary political issues in Indian and international politics. Since 2016, CBCS (Choice Based Credit System) 
                        has been implemented which marked the genesis of change in the University Education System. Besides, the routine three-year honors and program courses - 
                        the discipline of Political science also offers papers to other courses outside their specialization in the form of GE courses (Generic Elective).                                 We also offer SEC (Skill-Enhancement Course) and AECC (Ability Enhancement Compulsory Course) through which the students get the flexibility to select 
                        not only inter disciplinary but also intra disciplinary and skill-based courses.
